# BankApplication
# Overview:
This is a banking application designed to provide users with the ability to manage their accounts and perform basic banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and obtaining bank statements. The application interacts with a backend database to ensure that all transactions and account information are securely stored and accessible to the user.

# Features:
Database Connection: The application is connected to a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) that stores customer data, account information, transaction history, and other banking details. The database connection ensures real-time access to account details and transaction processing.

# Deposit:
Users can deposit funds into their bank account. The deposit functionality updates the user's balance in the database immediately, ensuring that the user's account reflects the correct amount after each transaction.

# Withdrawal:
The application allows users to withdraw funds from their accounts. Before a withdrawal is processed, the system checks the account balance to ensure the user has enough funds. If the balance is sufficient, the withdrawal is processed, and the account balance is updated in the database.

# Balance Enquiry:
Users can inquire about their current account balance at any time. The balance is retrieved from the database and displayed to the user. This feature provides real-time access to the user's financial status.

# Statement Generation:
The application can generate detailed account statements for a specific time period (e.g., weekly, monthly). The statement includes all deposits, withdrawals, and any other relevant transactions made during that period. This statement is fetched from the transaction history stored in the database.

# Database Structure:
The database schema consists of the following key tables:

AccountMaster: Stores account-related details (e.g., account number, account holder name , date , phone , email , balance).
Transactions: Stores transaction history (e.g., transaction ID, type, amount, date).
Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web-based interface).
# Backend: Java 
# Database: MySQL 
# Database Connection: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
# Security Measures:
# Data Encryption: 
All sensitive user data (e.g., account details, passwords) is encrypted before storage.
# Secure Transactions:
All financial transactions are processed using secure encryption protocols to protect user data during transfer.
# Authentication:
Users must authenticate themselves using secure login credentials (username and password) before accessing any banking features.
# User Experience:
The banking application is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and accessible across multiple platforms. It can be accessed via a web browser, and future updates may include mobile app support for even greater convenience.

# Future Enhancements:
Multi-Currency Support: The ability to handle multiple currencies for international users.
ATM Integration: Direct integration with ATM networks for real-time balance updates and withdrawals.
Notifications: Push notifications or email alerts for transaction confirmations, balance updates, and security alerts.
